# Deployment Guide

## Issue Resolution: PyTorch Version Compatibility

### Problem
The error `No matching distribution found for torch==2.8.0+cpu` occurs when deploying to cloud services because:

1. **Local vs Cloud**: The `+cpu` suffix is specific to PyTorch's custom index
2. **Cloud Services**: Use standard PyPI which only has `torch==2.8.0` (without `+cpu`)
3. **Version Availability**: Different platforms have different available versions

### Solution
Updated `requirements.txt` to use version ranges instead of specific CPU variants:

```
# OLD (causes deployment issues):
torch==2.8.0+cpu
torchvision==0.23.0+cpu
torchaudio==2.8.0+cpu

# NEW (cloud compatible):
torch>=2.7.0,<2.9.0
torchvision>=0.20.0,<0.25.0
torchaudio>=2.7.0,<2.9.0
```

## Deployment Instructions

### Streamlit Cloud
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect to Streamlit Cloud
3. The updated `requirements.txt` will work automatically

### Other Cloud Platforms
- **Heroku**: Works with updated requirements
- **Railway**: Compatible with version ranges
- **Replit**: Should work with flexible versions

### Local Development
If you prefer the CPU-specific versions locally:
```bash
pip install torch==2.8.0+cpu torchvision==0.23.0+cpu torchaudio==2.8.0+cpu --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Removed `+cpu` suffix**: Ensures compatibility across platforms
2. **Used version ranges**: More flexible for different environments
3. **Removed `pickle5`**: Not needed for Python 3.13 and causes build issues
4. **Maintained functionality**: App works the same with standard PyTorch

## Testing
The enhanced rule-based translation system works regardless of the PyTorch installation method, providing accurate Urdu-to-Roman transliteration.
